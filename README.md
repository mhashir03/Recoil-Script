# Logitech Anti-Recoil Script

A simple Lua macro script for Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) or G Hub that helps control vertical recoil in FPS games.

## 🎯 Features

- **Recoil Compensation:** Simulates small downward and lateral mouse movements while firing.
- **Activation Conditions:**

  - **Right mouse button (Mouse Button 3) held (ADS)**
  - **Left mouse button (Mouse Button 1) held (fire)**

## 🛠 Requirements

- A compatible Logitech mouse

## 📜 How It Works

While Caps Lock is enabled:
- Holding right-click (ADS) + left-click (fire) triggers the script.
- The script repeatedly moves the mouse down and slightly side-to-side to mimic recoil control.
